I attempted to slowing down the robot when it bumps into obstacles
but i kept having issues with the homebase also slowing down since
i was changing the speed in the motionhandler which the homebase also inherits from.
Once i got over that by having the homebase not change speed whenever it bumps into a entity or walls
or when the robot goes the same. The robot seemed to glitch out a lot more when it bumped into obstacles or the
walls so i ended up commenting it out. It is still there in my code but i do not run it currently, to save
myself from other issues i am getting. I also believe it does this because since the angle of incident
isn't perfect, in the occasions that the robot goes through the entities the speed keeps decreasing
and the robot gets stuck on the entity, draining it's battery and having me stuck in a glitchy situation.
Also the same with many people my collision off of other entities still isn't perfect.
Depending on your approach it usually bounces off the correct way or it just goes through the
middle, killing the battery a lot. Another bug that i am getting is reducing the play field to not include
where the simulation controls sits. The robot bounces off the side of the simulation control correctly but
occasionally glitches out when you approach the simulation control window from the bottom and the robot runs
off the screen. Not sure why exactly it does that but I'm assuming that the robot goes too deep into the simulation
control area that i blocked off to where it cannot get itself to bounce off the "wall" and just goes off into the abyss.
